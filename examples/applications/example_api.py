    certain actions (e.g., delete data object). Technically speaking, the identities concept is based on
    asymmetric cryptography and more specifically, public/private key pairs. In the SaaS context, we distinguish
    between a 'Keystore' and an 'Identity'. The 'Keystore' contains the private (secret) parts of an identity.
    This includes private keys and other credentials (e.g., SSH or Github credentials) that may be required.
    The 'Identity' is the public facing part of an identity, including public keys and information about the
    identity such as name and email address. An 'Identity' objects is derived from a 'Keystore'. While Identity
    can be shared freely, Keystore contents need to be kept safe (which is why parts of it is encrypted and
